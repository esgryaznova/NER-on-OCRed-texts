# NER-on-OCRed-texts
This repo is a part of the "NER on OCR-ed texts for Russian Language" Master's thesis at HSE Moscow.

## Abstract
This study focuses on the task of Named Entity Recognition (NER) on texts received from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the Russian language. NER is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing, that involves identifying and classifying named entities such as people, organizations, and locations. OCR technology has advanced significantly in recent years, making it possible to convert printed or handwritten text into digital form. However, OCR-ed texts often contain errors that can lead to inaccuracies in NER. This research explores these inaccuracies as reported in other studies, and implements three deep learning NER models on business documents in Russian to compare the results. Overall, this study provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of NER on OCR produced texts in the Russian language and contributes to the development of more accurate and efficient NER models.

## Repo description
This repo contains two files - one with models implementations, and second one with metrics calculations. As the data used in the research, as well as the OCR models, are properties of Raiffeisenbank Russia, they are not being published.
